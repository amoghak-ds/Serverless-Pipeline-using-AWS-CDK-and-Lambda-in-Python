First, let us understand "How to Get Started with AWS CDK" to work with the current project:

## GETTING STARTED WITH AWS CDK
CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is a framework for defining cloud infrastructure as code and provisioning it through Cloud Formation templates. You can connect your AWS resources together (even across Stacks) and grant permissions using simple, intent-oriented API's. In short, it is defined as "cloud infrastructure as code", i.e., provisioning cloud infrastructure using programming languages. CDK supports: TypeScript, JavaScript,Python, Java, C#/.Net, and Go languages
For more information and documentation about CDK, refer to: "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html"

Getting started with AWS CDK includes the following steps:

# STEP 1: PREREQUISITES

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

An AWS account: You'll need an AWS account to use AWS CDK.

AWS CLI: Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and configure it with your AWS credentials. You can download and install it from the AWS CLI website: "https://aws.amazon.com/cli/"

Node.js and npm: AWS CDK uses Node.js for its CLI. You can download Node.js from the official website: "https://nodejs.org/"

## STEP 2 : Install AWS CDK

Open a terminal or command prompt and install AWS CDK globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```
Verify that AWS CDK is installed correctly (version) by running:
```bash
cdk --version
```
## STEP 3 : Configure AWS CDK
AWS CDK uses the AWS CLI's configuration to access your AWS account. Make sure you've already configured the AWS CLI using `aws configure`. If not, run:
```bash
aws configure
```
You'll be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format. For more help on CLI, refer to: "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/cli/latest/userguide/aws-cli.pdf#cli-chap-getting-started"

## STEP 4 : Create a CDK App
Now, let's create our first CDK app. We will use the following command to get started:
```bash
cdk init app --language=python
```
Replace Python with your preferred programming language if you prefer a different one (e.g., `typescript`, `javascript`, etc.).

## STEP 5 : Navigate to your CDK App Directory
Change your current working directory to the newly created CDK app folder:
```bash
cd <your-app-name>
```
## STEP 6 : Define AWS CDK Stacks
AWS CDK projects consist of one or more "stacks." A stack is a set of AWS resources that are created and managed together. You can define your stacks in the `lib/<app-name>-stack.ts` (or .js or .py, depending on your chosen language) file. So,an example Python CDK stack definition in `lib/<app-name>-stack.py`:
```python
 from aws_cdk import core

class MyCdkStack(core.Stack):

    def __init__(self, scope: core.Construct, id: str, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(scope, id, **kwargs)

        # Define AWS resources here
        # For example, create an S3 bucket:
        from aws_cdk import aws_s3 as s3
        bucket = s3.Bucket(
            self,
            "MyCdkBucket",
            versioned=True,
        )
```
## STEP 7 : Deploy the Stack
Deploy your CDK stack to create AWS resources. Run the following command from your CDK app's root directory:
```bash
cdk deploy
```
CDK will provide a preview of the changes to be made and ask for confirmation. Type 'y' to proceed.

## STEP 8 : Explore and Manage your CDK Stack
You can now explore your AWS resources in the AWS Management Console or manage them programmatically using CDK.

## STEP 9 : Cleanup (Optional)
If you want to remove the resources created by your CDK stack, run:
```bash
cdk destroy
```
This will delete the AWS resources but won't remove the CDK app itself.

And Boom! You've created your first AWS CDK app and deployed a stack. You can continue to define more stacks, integrate with other AWS services, and use CDK to manage your infrastructure as code (IaC).
